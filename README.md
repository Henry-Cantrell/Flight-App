This project is a flight booker made using Ruby on Rails.

See it live here: https://flight-booker-1997.herokuapp.com/

It allows users to:

    Select departure and arrival flights along with a date from a populated dropdown list
    Choose a compatible flight
    Book themselves as well as other passengers on the flight

The application logic was written using Ruby on Rails and the graphical elements were created via Bulma.
